            Hello! My name is Brian Truong, and I am a Temple University graduate with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science.
            Growing up, I fell in love playing video games! They have been a significant part of my life and have helped me develop problem-solving skills and critical thinking.
            Some of my favorite games include Mount and Blade: Warband,
            Battlerite, Satisfactory, and many more. During my time playing Battlerite I went on to place 2nd in the
            <a href="https://www.start.gg/tournament/moonlit-battlegrounds-br-3v3-3/event/3v3/brackets/1108486/1726440" target="_blank">Moonlit Battlegrounds Tournament</a>
            where my team and I won $60. Showcasing my skills in a competitive environment and as well as being able to communicate and work with a team to achieve a common goal.
            </p>
            <p class="text-start" style="text-indent: 2.5em;">
              My time using technology and solving puzzles and challenges in games is what
              led me to pursue a career in computer science. I am passionate about learning new technologies and programming languages
              to develop software applications that can help solve real-world problems. I am currently seeking opportunities to work
              as a software developer to gain hands-on experience and further develop my skills in software development.
            </p>

              I also own a tabby cat named Mo who is 20 lbs and goes crazy for treats. His favorite toy is a cat dancer, and he loves to
              play with it. My partner and I adopted him on August 27th 2023 through <a href="https://phillypaws.org/">PAWS</a> and he has been a great addition to our family.
              We fell in love with him the moment we saw him and knew we had to take him home.
              Here is a photo of him!
